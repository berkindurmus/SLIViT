# SLIViT: a general AI framework for medical-feature diagnosis from limited 3D biomedical-imaging data


We present SLIViT, a deep-learning framework that accurately measures disease-related risk factors in volumetric biomedical imaging, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, optical coherence tomography (OCT) scans, and ultrasound videos. 


Notably, compared to existing approaches, SLIViT can be applied even when only a small number of annotated training samples is available, which is often a constraint in medical applications.

# SLIViT: a general AI framework for medical-feature diagnosis from limited 3D biomedical-imaging data

SLIViT is a deep-learning framework that accurately measures disease-related risk factors in volumetric biomedical imaging, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans, optical coherence tomography (OCT) scans, and ultrasound videos. 

In order to run SLIViT, please make sure all the relevant packages listed in requirements.txt are properly installed and refer to SLIViT.ipynb.

A pre-trained backbone is provided (see backbone.pth.zip) although one may wish to train the model from scratch.

A code snippet with an example of how to load a pre-trained SLIViT model and run inference on a given volume is provided at the end of the SLIViT.ipynb notebook.
